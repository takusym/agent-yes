 * body budget can be quoted. Hence a check on the sum rather than a smaller
 * hard-coded limit.
 *
 * Returns the error text, or null when the send fits. `envelopeLen` is 0 for a
 * `--raw` send and for a slash command, both of which go out unwrapped — the
 * budget is then the whole cap, which is why this is computed per send and not
 * once.
 *

 * caller-error check run ahead of the reachability probe.

 * a row that reads `idle` — exactly what a healthy waiting lane reads as — until
 * a send fails with ENXIO. Measured on this host: a row listed `idle 1d` whose
 * `ay send` returned `ENXIO … open '<statedir>/fifo/<pid>.stdin'`.
 *
 * Both runtimes hold the FIFO open for the agent's whole lifetime (Rust opens it
 * O_RDWR, TS keeps a paired dummy writer), so a live agent never momentarily
 * loses its reader mid-session: the probe does not flap, and O_NONBLOCK means it
 * cannot block. The one window where a HEALTHY agent has no reader is between
 * registration and the reader's first open at spawn; callers must not conclude
 * death inside it — see the quiet-threshold gate in `deriveLiveState`.
 *
 * Fails OPEN by design. Only the two errnos that mean "nobody is on the other
 * end" (ENXIO: FIFO with no reader; ENOENT: FIFO gone) return "unreachable";
